                            principles of sovereignty and interoperability — the right for communities to be sovereign
                            over
                            their infrastructure and applications, and for sovereign communities to be able to
                            peacefully
                            interoperate with one another. This philosophy is grounded in our humility before the
                            extraordinarily rich cultural diversity of human beings. It is a tacit recognition of the
                            fundamental limits of our discretionary reason in organizing planetary sustainability, and
                            yet a

                            self-governance.
                            Cosmos offers a meta-political economy, one that recognizes the need for the representation
                            of
                            different interests at different scales and for an approach to money that can bridge the gap
                            from local to global and back. Let’s call this philosophy the Mind of Cosmos.&quot;</em>

            <h5><strong>Fantom:</strong></h5>
            <p>Fantom is a blockchain that will forever live
                rent-free in my heart. I swear it&#x27;s not due to all of the endearing Halloween-themed protocols
                that live on the Fantom blockchain. Fantom has a user-friendly, and unique DeFi experience that
                separates itself from many of its Layer 1 competitors. I would know since as a complete newbie, I
                learned how to use DeFi through Fantom. Every month or so when I yield farm, I set time aside to
                catch up with some of my favorite protocols (BeethovenX, Reaper.farm, spooky, and spirit swap). Even
                with all of the misfortune that occurred with Fantom this year, their community remains spirited and
                engaged.
            </p>

            <p>I&#x27;ll tell you one thing about Fantom,
                it&#x27;s far from the light-hearted &quot;ghost chain&quot; puns I hear from time to time.
            </p>

            </i>

            <p>One of these days, I hope to build a passion project on Fantom. I still keep up with all of
                Fantom&#x27;s
                exciting developments which are in the works for 2023 (Fantom Virtual Machine, Revamped Tokenomic
                Models
                which incentivizes new builders,
                and Andre Cronje&#x27;s comeback tour). I am still bullish on Fantom and believe it is one of the
                most undervalued Layer 1 blockchains in crypto.

            <h5><strong>Ethereum:</strong></h5>
            <p>I recently delved into the world of Ethereum and
                was blown away by the depth and potential of this blockchain platform. The community of developers
                working on Ethereum is truly innovative and driven by a desire to create a more censorship-resistant
                and transparent society.
            </p>

            <p>They also inspired me to dive into blockchain
                development. Ethereum&#x27;s focus on censorship resistance and transparency align with my values,
                and the wealth of innovative developers within its community makes it an exciting space to be a part
                of.
            </p>

            <p>In my research, I came across two books that
                helped me understand the significance of decentralization and Ethereum&#x27;s journey:
                &quot;<strong>The Infinite Machine</strong>&quot; by Defiant Founder Camila Russo and
                &quot;<strong>The Cryptopians</strong>&quot; by OG crypto journalist, Laura Shin. These books gave
                me a newfound appreciation for Ethereum and the challenges it has faced, ultimately inspiring me to
                dive deeper into the world of blockchain development.

            <h3><strong>Switching to Programming / From Degen to Dev:</strong> </h3>

            <h5><strong>Harvard Universities CS50 Course:</strong></h5>
            <p>In May 2022, I decided to try something completely
                new and enrolled in Harvard University&#x27;s CS50 course, even though I had zero programming
                experience. It was a challenge, but I enjoyed the lectures, which were taught by Prof. David Malan.
                He made even the most complex topics, like data structures, feel interesting and accessible by using
                props like puppets. I spent a lot of time watching the lectures over and over to try to understand
                everything. Even though I had a tough time with the coding, I appreciate how entertaining and
                helpful the lectures were. CS50 has a huge following, and I can see why. When I finished the course,
                I felt grateful for everything I learned. I’ll forever have fond memories of CS50.
            </p>

            <h5><strong>Programming on Ethereum:</strong></h5>
            <p>These days, I&#x27;ve been trying my hand at
                blockchain development, specifically, the 32-hour Chainlink course on YouTube taught by Patrick
                Collins. I got the suggestion from a Chainlink Developer Advocate I spoke with at a local crypto
                hangout. Although I have several months, (maybe years) more of programming practice to achieve the
                necessary skills needed to build safe and efficient blockchain smart contracts, I know Patrick will
                keep me motivated throughout. I look forward to using developer tooling platforms such as Chainlink
                which allow for more enjoyable developer experience.

            <h5><strong>Crypto Meetup Story:</strong></h5>
            <p>Speaking of Crypto meetups, I went to my first
                crypto hangout in Late October. I am not one to use my phone as I get overwhelmed with having to
                catch up with all of the conversations that ensue with crypto telegrams. As a result, I mixed up the
                meetup I was supposed to go to. I thought I was attending a costume party. So I arrived at a
                penthouse in Back Bay Boston, outfitted from head to toe in a Beetlejuice costume. When the elevator
                doors opened as I entered the meetup lobby, my heart dropped as I was the only one in a suite full
                of 200-plus crypto enthusiasts, VCs, and blockchain developers wearing a costume.
            </p>

            <p>However, 99% of my time at the meetup, I
                didn&#x27;t even realize I was the only one in a costume. The Boston DAO community made me feel
                welcomed as we laughed off my mishap. I didn&#x27;t receive one judgmental look or any snarky
                comments during the two hours I was at the meetup. That might have been the moment I realized that
                crypto is one of the most welcoming communities I have ever been a part of.

            <h5><strong>Why I&#x27;m both passionate and
                    optimistic about the future of DeFi.</strong></h5>
            <p>First and foremost, I believe that DeFi has the
                potential to bring about real change and make today&#x27;s financial systems more transparent, fair,
                and accessible to everyone. It allows for greater control and autonomy over our financial decisions
                and gives us the power to shape the future of finance in a way that benefits us all. This is
                particularly important in a world where traditional financial systems often exclude or discriminate
                against certain groups, and where access to financial services is not always equal.
            </p>

            <p>In addition to this, I am excited about the
                innovation and creativity that DeFi brings to the table. The use of smart contracts, decentralized
                exchanges, NFTs, and other cutting-edge technologies allows for the creation of new financial
                products and services that were previously unimaginable. This not only opens up new possibilities
                for how we can use and interact with money, but it also creates opportunities for people to build
                and grow businesses in this space.
            </p>

            <p>Finally, I am bullish on the future of DeFi
                because I believe that it is here to stay. As more people become aware of and interested in DeFi, I
                expect to see it continue to evolve and develop. This means that there will be more opportunities
                for people to get involved and make a positive impact, whether as users, developers, or
                entrepreneurs. All of these factors make me confident in the long-term potential of DeFi and excited
                about what the future holds.

                    <li><strong>Educate yourself before you invest a single dime in crypto:</strong> The crypto
                        space is
                        constantly evolving, and it&#x27;s important to keep up with the latest developments and
                        trends.
                        Make sure you educate yourself about the basics of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency,
                        as
                        well as the specific projects and protocols you&#x27;re interested in.<ol type="a"

                            <li>Did you notice how my biggest mistakes were all from my first few months exploring
                                DeFi
                                protocols? If I took the time to better understand the risks and flaws with these
                                protocols then, I would have saved myself a ton of money. You don&#x27;t have to get
                                rekt to learn in crypto. It cost nothing to join community discords, hang out on
                                crypto
                                Twitter and follow the events in real-time. Hell, even if these protocols were still
                                going strong today, they would still be down %90 or more. If you need proof, look at
                                the
                                weekly chart of your favorite altcoin over the past year.

                    <li><strong>Use a hardware wallet:</strong> A hardware wallet is a physical device that stores
                        your
                        crypto offline, making it much harder for hackers to access. This is a secure way to store
                        your
                        crypto and protect your investment. Also, don&#x27;t leave your crypto on a centralized
                        exchange, as it&#x27;s vulnerable to bankruptcy, hacks, and theft.

                        a friendly and collaborative place, and there are many opportunities to connect with others
                        who
                        share your interests. Join discords forums and communities, attend meetups and conferences,

                    <li><strong>Invest in yourself over crypto:</strong> Instead of rushing to invest in crypto,
                        consider investing in yourself first. Building up your skills and knowledge can provide
                        personal

            <h2><strong> Closing Remarks</h2></strong>
            <p>As we come to the end of this exploration of DeFi,
                it&#x27;s clear that this exciting and innovative technology has the potential to bring about
                significant positive change in the world. By providing greater accessibility, transparency, and
                accountability, DeFi can help build a more fair and inclusive financial system that serves the needs
                of people and communities around the globe.
            </p>

            <p>So, as we move forward into 2023, let&#x27;s
                embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. Whether you&#x27;re a yield farmer, degen,
                Web3 journalist, blockchain developer, or simply a spirited DeFi user, we all have a role to play in
                shaping the future of DeFi and crypto. Let&#x27;s work together to build a brighter, more
                decentralized future for all of us.
            </p>

            <p>Thank you for joining me on this journey and for
                taking the time to read my barely coherent blog detailing my misfortunes, experiences, and the
                compelling world of DeFi. I hope that you&#x27;ve gained a better understanding of the topics
                discussed and what not to do.
            </p>

            <p>And with that, I&#x27;ll leave you with one final
                thought:
                <strong>
                    <span style="color: #ff00bf;">never underestimate the power of a collective group of
                        people who
                        want nothing more than to
                        bring about radical change,
                    </span>
                </strong>
                even if it means turning the world of finance on its
                head (or, in
                this
                case, making it completely decentralized).
