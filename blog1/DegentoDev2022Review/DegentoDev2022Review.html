            <h1><strong>My Crypto Adventures in 2022: From Degen to Dev</strong></h1>
            <p>Crypto in 2022 has been a rollercoaster ride, with a series of game-changing events that have sent
                shockwaves through the industry. From the Olympus DAO forks that offered eye-popping APYs to the
                collapse of FTX, it’s been a year of highs and lows that has kept investors and enthusiasts on their
                toes. From the day I entered in late 2021, I’ve been constantly amazed and sometimes bewildered by
                the
                wild ride that is the world of cryptocurrency.
            </p>
            <p>Thinking back on 2022, I wanted to share my thoughts and experiences in this review. Whether you’re
                new
                to crypto or a seasoned pro, I hope my insights and reflections will be helpful as you navigate this
                exciting and sometimes overwhelming world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and the overall crypto
                space.
                I will discuss the following topics:

                and crypto. So, here it is - my 2022 reflection on my year in crypto.
            </p>
            <h2><strong>What is Yield Farming?</strong></h2>
            <p>One of the biggest takeaways from my year in DeFi has been my involvement in yield farming. Yield
                farming
                is a way to earn tokenized rewards for providing liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi)
                protocols.
                DeFi protocols are built on blockchain networks and offer financial services such as lending,
                borrowing,
                and trading. This is all possible due to smart contracts. Smart Contracts are digital contracts that
                use
                code to automate the execution of agreements between parties, making transactions more efficient and
                secure.
            </p>
            <p>To participate in yield farming, an individual or entity can supply assets such as cryptocurrency to
                a
                liquidity pool, which is essentially a collection of assets that can be traded on a decentralized
                exchange (DEX). By supplying assets to the liquidity pool, the individual or entity is helping to
                facilitate trades on the DEX and is therefore entitled to a share of the fees generated from these
                trades. This share is typically paid out in the form of tokens that are specific to the DeFi
                protocol
                being used.

            <h2>My Yield Farming Experiences &amp; Thoughts</h2>

            </p>

            <h2>My Yield Farming Experiences &amp; Thoughts</h2>
            <p>Yield farming was my first real foray into the
                world of DeFi, and I have to say, it&#x27;s been an incredibly humbling but exciting experience. I
                started yield farming to earn passive income on the cryptocurrencies I hold.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>Through yield farming, you&#x27;ll acquire
                worthwhile insights for understanding the value of specific cryptocurrencies by getting first-hand
                experience with how efficient or sluggish different DeFi protocols behave. My rationale is the more
                enjoyable and easier to use, the more likely a DeFi protocol would realize increased adoption. You
                can learn a lot from a DeFi protocol simply by using them. From yield farming and being an active
                participant in DeFi, you get a front-row seat on DeFi topics such as game theory, DAO governance,
                algorithmic stablecoins, token issuance, and on-chain analytics. If you invest in crypto, I cannot
                overstate the value of trying out these DeFi protocols. I guarantee you will gain valuable insights
                into the coins and tokens you hold. At the very least, you&#x27;ll uncover the exhilarating world of
                DeFi.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>However, yield farming is not without its risk. It
                can be extremely risky for a newbie entering DeFi for the first time. Some less unfortunate events I
                witnessed in DeFi were Sifu getting doxed, the Solidly Wars, and the Terra Luna Death Spiral.

            <h2><strong>Significant Events in DeFi (The Bad).</strong></h2>
            <p>
            </p>
            <h4><strong>Time Wonderland &amp; Sifu:</strong></h4>
            <p>Sifu is the Treasury manager for the Time
                Wonderland Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). At its peak, Time Wonderland maintained over
                1 billion dollars of crypto assets in its treasury. Sifu is very active and well-liked within the
                Time Wonderland community. So it came as a shock when Sifu&#x27;s real-life identity was revealed as
                Michael Patryn, co-founder of the infamous QuadrigaCX.
            </p>
            <p>QuadrigaCX was a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange
                that faced financial difficulties and controversy following the unexpected death of its CEO, who was
                the only person with access to the company&#x27;s cold storage wallets, resulting in significant
                losses for its customers.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>Patryn claims he left the company in 2016 before
                the company allegedly became a Ponzi scheme resulting in over $200 million in losses after business
                partner Gerald Cotten died.
                In September 2022, Wonderland voted to re-hire Patryn aka Sifu as their Risk Officer in a vote which
                passed with ~90% approval. Since then, Wonderland has been pretty steady with their token (wMemo)
                surviving the scandal and outperforming many rival DAOs. However, Wonderland may never see the highs
                it once had with its reputation and trust fractured by this event.

            <h4><strong>Solidly Wars:</strong></h4>
            <p>In February 2022, Andre Cronje announced Solidly,
                a Decentralized Exchange that operates entirely on smart contracts. This project can get quite
                complicated so to save time and effort, I&#x27;ll just breeze through why Solidly was so hyped.
                Although not entirely correct, All token emissions would go to Liquidity Providers. The top 25 DeFi
                protocols on Fantom in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) received a solidly NFT, which they could
                use to receive Solidly token emissions.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>

            <iframe width="663" height="382" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x3vhNw2g-CU"

                allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>Wanting to get involved I uncovered veDAO. The
                entire objective of veDAO was to get one of these Solidly NFTs. I liked the concept and joined
                veDAO. veDAO quickly acquired 2 billion dollars in TVL, which made it #2 on Fantom. To combat this
                phenomenon, native Fantom protocols such as Scream, Geist, and SpookySwap, unified to create 0xDAO.
            </p>

            <p>When all was said and done, both veDAO and 0xDao
                acquired a significant amount of voting power for the Solidly emissions. The day Solidly launched,
                it was riddled with bugs, a shoddy UI, and a congested Fantom blockchain. Andre caved from the
                backlash and left DeFi for a while. The entire Fantom ecosystem crashed as many of my fellow yield
                farmers moved on from the Solidly Wars and pivoted their assets and attention to different
                blockchains (Arura, Metis, and Terra). Which leads me to my next play.

            <h4><strong>The Death of Terra Luna:</strong></h4>
            <p>Now that the Solidly Wars were done, I was
                searching for a new DeFi ecosystem to explore. I arrived at Terra in March of 2022. What drew me to
                Terra was how well their DeFi ecosystem operated. Decentralized Applications (dApps) such as Anchor,
                Mirror, and Astroport allowed for frictionless transactions. Additionally, the 19% APY for
                depositing your UST stable coins on Anchor was enticing enough for me to look past all of the
                immature tweets by Terra founder Do Kwon.

                <h6>
                    Just so you get a basic understanding of how Terra Luna worked, below is a quick
                    explanation:

                    <i>
                        Terra Luna is a payment platform that uses a special type of cryptocurrency called a stablecoin.
                        Stablecoins are like regular cryptocurrencies, but they&#x27;re designed to stay the same
                        value as other kinds of money, like dollars or euros. You can use Terra Luna to buy and sell
                        things, save your money, or exchange it for other types of currency. The Terra Luna platform
                        is built on a special kind of computer network called a blockchain, which helps keep your
                        money safe and makes it easy to use.
                    </i>
                </p>
            </center>

            <p>Anyhow, as much as Terra Luna was praised by its
                community, it also drew many critics, who rightfully pointed out the flaws of the Terra Luna
                Ecosystem, citing how the 19% yield is not sustainable and how the entire ecosystem will go to zero
                in the event of a bank run. The critics wouldn&#x27;t have to wait long for their theories to come
                to fruition. On May 9th, 2022, Terra Luna stable coin UST loses its $1 peg after it deployed its
                available treasury funds to defend the $1 peg and falls to as low as 35 cents. UST never recovered
                and is trading around 2 cents at the time of this writing.

            <p>Although it was no secret to the crypto community
                that this result was entirely possible, it was unreal to see this all happen in real-time. My heart
                goes out to everyone who lost large sums of their money in all of this.

            <h2><strong>Lessons Learned From My Degen Days:</strong></h2>
            <p>I&#x27;ve made a lot of mistakes while yield
                farming on DeFi protocols, and I&#x27;ve learned a lot from those experiences. I&#x27;m not afraid
                to admit that I made some poor choices and paid a high price for them. But I&#x27;ve learned
                valuable lessons from those mistakes, and I&#x27;m happy to share those experiences and lessons with
                others. I see those mistakes as a kind of &quot;tuition&quot; that has helped me become a more
                knowledgeable and experienced investor. I wear those scars as a reminder to always be careful and to
                continue learning from my mistakes.

            <h2><strong>My Favorite Crypto Communities:</strong>
            </h2>
            <p>Anyhow, with the lows I&#x27;ve experienced, there
                were considerably more corners of DeFi where I found communities that were both inspiring and
                welcoming. Here are a few that come to mind.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>Cosmos:</strong></h4>
            <p>Hands down, DeFi protocols that are built on top
                of Cosmos all have some of the smoothest user experiences in all of DeFi. Shout out to my favorite
                software wallet (Keplr) for being a big part of the ease of use with Cosmos Blockchains!
            </p>

            <p>
                Cosmos is one of the most forward-thinking and
                innovative communities in crypto for its entire existence. I am particularly impressed by how
                engaged and passionate the Cosmos community continues to be. They take their ideology of sovereign
                blockchains having complete control over their fortune as seriously as they take their governance. I
                booked marked this excerpt below which I feel, perfectly represents Cosmos.

                <blockquote id="bf2b4ed4-bc2c-497b-9b61-c717261a0561">&quot;<em>At the heart of Cosmos are the
                        principles of sovereignty and interoperability — the right for communities to be sovereign over
                        their infrastructure and applications, and for sovereign communities to be able to peacefully
                        interoperate with one another. This philosophy is grounded in our humility before the
                        extraordinarily rich cultural diversity of human beings. It is a tacit recognition of the
                        fundamental limits of our discretionary reason in organizing planetary sustainability, and yet a
                        call to use technology as simply and as best we can to facilitate sustainable self-governance.
                        Cosmos offers a meta-political economy, one that recognizes the need for the representation of
                        different interests at different scales and for an approach to money that can bridge the gap
                        from
                        local
                        to global and back. Let’s call this philosophy the Mind of Cosmos.&quot;</em>

            <h4><strong>Fantom:</strong></h4>
            <p>Fantom is a blockchain that will forever live
                rent-free in my heart. I swear it&#x27;s not due to all of the endearing Halloween-themed protocols
                that live on the Fantom blockchain. Fantom has a user-friendly, and unique DeFi experience that
                separates itself from many of its Layer 1 competitors. I would know since as a complete newbie, I
                learned how to use DeFi through Fantom. Every month or so when I yield farm, I set time aside to
                catch up with some of my favorite protocols (BeethovenX, Reaper.farm, spooky, and spirit swap). Even
                with all of the misfortune that occurred with Fantom this year, their community remains spirited and
                engaged.
            </p>

            <p>I&#x27;ll tell you one thing about Fantom,
                it&#x27;s far from the light-hearted &quot;ghost chain&quot; puns I hear from time to time.
            </p>

            </i>

            <p>One of these days, I hope to build a passion project on Fantom. I still keep up with all of Fantom&#x27;s
                exciting developments which are in the works for 2023 (Fantom Virtual Machine, Revamped Tokenomic Models
                which incentivizes new builders,
                and Andre Cronje&#x27;s comeback tour). I am still bullish on Fantom and believe it is one of the
                most undervalued Layer 1 blockchains in crypto.

            <h4><strong>Ethereum:</strong></h4>
            <p>I recently delved into the world of Ethereum and
                was blown away by the depth and potential of this blockchain platform. The community of developers
                working on Ethereum is truly innovative and driven by a desire to create a more censorship-resistant
                and transparent society.
            </p>

            <p>They also inspired me to dive into blockchain
                development. Ethereum&#x27;s focus on censorship resistance and transparency align with my values,
                and the wealth of innovative developers within its community makes it an exciting space to be a part
                of.
            </p>

            <p>In my research, I came across two books that
                helped me understand the significance of decentralization and Ethereum&#x27;s journey:
                &quot;<strong>The Infinite Machine</strong>&quot; by Defiant Founder Camila Russo and
                &quot;<strong>The Cryptopians</strong>&quot; by OG crypto journalist, Laura Shin. These books gave
                me a newfound appreciation for Ethereum and the challenges it has faced, ultimately inspiring me to
                dive deeper into the world of blockchain development.

            <h1>Switching to Programming / From Degen to Dev: </h1>

            <h3><strong>Harvard Universities CS50 Course:</strong></h3>
            <p>In May 2022, I decided to try something completely
                new and enrolled in Harvard University&#x27;s CS50 course, even though I had zero programming
                experience. It was a challenge, but I enjoyed the lectures, which were taught by Prof. David Malan.
                He made even the most complex topics, like data structures, feel interesting and accessible by using
                props like puppets. I spent a lot of time watching the lectures over and over to try to understand
                everything. Even though I had a tough time with the coding, I appreciate how entertaining and
                helpful the lectures were. CS50 has a huge following, and I can see why. When I finished the course,
                I felt grateful for everything I learned. I’ll forever have fond memories of CS50.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>Programming on Ethereum:</strong></h3>
            <p>These days, I&#x27;ve been trying my hand at
                blockchain development, specifically, the 32-hour Chainlink course on YouTube taught by Patrick
                Collins. I got the suggestion from a Chainlink Developer Advocate I spoke with at a local crypto
                hangout. Although I have several months, (maybe years) more of programming practice to achieve the
                necessary skills needed to build safe and efficient blockchain smart contracts, I know Patrick will
                keep me motivated throughout. I look forward to using developer tooling platforms such as Chainlink
                which allow for more enjoyable developer experience.

            <h3><strong>Crypto Meetup Story:</strong></h3>
            <p>Speaking of Crypto meetups, I went to my first
                crypto hangout in Late October. I am not one to use my phone as I get overwhelmed with having to
                catch up with all of the conversations that ensue with crypto telegrams. As a result, I mixed up the
                meetup I was supposed to go to. I thought I was attending a costume party. So I arrived at a
                penthouse in Back Bay Boston, outfitted from head to toe in a Beetlejuice costume. When the elevator
                doors opened as I entered the meetup lobby, my heart dropped as I was the only one in a suite full
                of 200-plus crypto enthusiasts, VCs, and blockchain developers wearing a costume.
            </p>

            <p>However, 99% of my time at the meetup, I
                didn&#x27;t even realize I was the only one in a costume. The Boston DAO community made me feel
                welcomed as we laughed off my mishap. I didn&#x27;t receive one judgmental look or any snarky
                comments during the two hours I was at the meetup. That might have been the moment I realized that
                crypto is one of the most welcoming communities I have ever been a part of.

            <h2><strong>Why I&#x27;m both passionate and
                    optimistic about the future of DeFi.</strong></h2>
            <p>First and foremost, I believe that DeFi has the
                potential to bring about real change and make today&#x27;s financial systems more transparent, fair,
                and accessible to everyone. It allows for greater control and autonomy over our financial decisions
                and gives us the power to shape the future of finance in a way that benefits us all. This is
                particularly important in a world where traditional financial systems often exclude or discriminate
                against certain groups, and where access to financial services is not always equal.
            </p>

            <p>In addition to this, I am excited about the
                innovation and creativity that DeFi brings to the table. The use of smart contracts, decentralized
                exchanges, NFTs, and other cutting-edge technologies allows for the creation of new financial
                products and services that were previously unimaginable. This not only opens up new possibilities
                for how we can use and interact with money, but it also creates opportunities for people to build
                and grow businesses in this space.
            </p>

            <p>Finally, I am bullish on the future of DeFi
                because I believe that it is here to stay. As more people become aware of and interested in DeFi, I
                expect to see it continue to evolve and develop. This means that there will be more opportunities
                for people to get involved and make a positive impact, whether as users, developers, or
                entrepreneurs. All of these factors make me confident in the long-term potential of DeFi and excited
                about what the future holds.

                            protocols then, I would have saved myself a ton of money. You don&#x27;t have to get
                            rekt to learn in crypto. It cost nothing to join community discords, hang out on crypto
                            Twitter and follow the events in real-time. Hell, even if these protocols were still
                            going strong today, they would still be down %90 or more. If you need proof, look at the

            <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
            <p>As we come to the end of this exploration of DeFi,
                it&#x27;s clear that this exciting and innovative technology has the potential to bring about
                significant positive change in the world. By providing greater accessibility, transparency, and
                accountability, DeFi can help build a more fair and inclusive financial system that serves the needs
                of people and communities around the globe.
            </p>

            <p>So, as we move forward into 2023, let&#x27;s
                embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. Whether you&#x27;re a yield farmer, degen,
                Web3 journalist, blockchain developer, or simply a spirited DeFi user, we all have a role to play in
                shaping the future of DeFi and crypto. Let&#x27;s work together to build a brighter, more
                decentralized future for all of us.
            </p>

            <p>Thank you for joining me on this journey and for
                taking the time to read my barely coherent blog detailing my misfortunes, experiences, and the
                compelling world of DeFi. I hope that you&#x27;ve gained a better understanding of the topics

                <strong>
                    <span style="color: #ff00bf;">never underestimate the power of a collective group of
                        people who
