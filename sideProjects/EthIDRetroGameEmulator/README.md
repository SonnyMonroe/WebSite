# Eth.id Retro Game Emulator

This project is a simple retro game emulator that allows you to play classic games from various consoles, including GameBoy, N64, Play Station and Classic Arcade Games. Right Inside of your ETH.id Profile.

The Eth.id Retro Game Emulator project is a perfect example of how eth.id makes it simple to add unique and engaging functionality to your profile. By leveraging iFrames, this project seamlessly integrates classic retro games into your eth.id profile, creating a fun and engaging experience for users.

With eth.id's user-friendly platform, adding this kind of functionality is simple and intuitive, allowing even those with limited coding experience to create exciting and innovative projects. I hope this project inspires others to explore the possibilities of eth.id and to create their own unique and engaging projects that showcase the power of web technologies.

## How to Use

To use the emulator, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You will see a dropdown menu with options for each console. Click on the console you want to emulate, and then select a game from the dropdown menu.

When you select a game, it will load in an iframe below the dropdown menu. You can then play the game using the keyboard or gamepad.

If you have any loading errors or want to exit the game, just refrest your web browser and you will return to the main menu.

## Customization

If you want to add your own games to the emulator, simply find the embed code for the game you want to add and add a new `li` element to the appropriate console dropdown menu. You can also customize the styling of the dropdown menus and buttons by editing the `style.css` file.

## Motivation For Eth.id Retro Game Emulator

The Eth.id Retro Emulator project was born out of a desire to create something unique and innovative that could be integrated into the eth.id platform. As a fan of retro gaming, the idea of being able to play classic games directly from my eth.id profile was very appealing. I was also excited by the possibilities that using iFrames could bring to the project, as it allowed for seamless integration of different web technologies.

My goal for this project was to create a fun and engaging experience for eth.id users while also showcasing the potential of iFrames and how they can be used to enhance the functionality of web applications. By providing a simple and easy-to-use retro games emulator, I hope to inspire others to think outside the box and explore all of the different things that can be done with iFrames on their Eth.id Profiles.

## Credits

This project was inspired by the Retro Games CC website, which provides embed codes for classic games from various consoles. I want to thank the developers and volunteers of Retro Games CC for their contributions to the retro gaming community.

Last but not least, I want to thank the eth.id creators! Thanks to their website, even coding-challenged folks like myself can express themselves in a unique and fun way. Embedding iFrames onto eth.id is a genius move that sets it apart from other profile customization sites. I appreciate the add because let's be honest, I'm not the world's greatest developer. I look forward to seeing all of the unique Eth.id profiles and I can't wait to see eth.id grow and succeed. You guys are amazing!
